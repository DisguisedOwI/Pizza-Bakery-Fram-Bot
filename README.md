# Tutorial:
If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click "Run Anyways". You may need to click "more info" to see this option.
This warning is entirely harmless and only shows because the app is not signed. Signing it would cost me [€359/year.](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html)
and Do not run the installer as an Administrator!

If this happens to you what you can do is click Green Button or change server.

I recommend that you do this on a private server.

# If you have a problem with the bot.
What you can try then is to replace the images in the pizza folder.

The left side has been reported by some to be a bit buggy

Change your FPS to higher or lower it can fix the problems for some (probably won't work)


# Virustotal.
It will likely be mistakenly flagged as a trojan.
I’m not sure how to fix this, I guess I have to get better at coding lol.
Since it moves your mouse and takes a screenshot to identify the Pizza, the system might see it as a threat?.

or just probably because i haven't signed it. [cost me €359/year.](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html)
