1. Walk along to the right of all the stations go to the one that has boxes under it or Left Side.

2. Zoom out as much as you can and pull down your camera.

3. Try Line up the red dots with the bowl and the Green Button.

4. Don't forget to !SIT DOWN! [Emotes > Other > Sit] when using it so you don't pass out of a heart attack.
5. if you can change to Robloxian 2.0 or something similar, because it will keep you from slipping on the floor and you can change it in the game.

I recommend that you do this on a private server.

# if you have a problem does not detect the pizza.
what you can try then is to replace the images in the pizza folder.

# Virustotal.
it will be false flagged as a trojan.

because it can move your mouse and it takes a screenshot which it uses to find out what the Pizza is.

and because it is not signed.
