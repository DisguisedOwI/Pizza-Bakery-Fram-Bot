If you get a warning that the app cannot be opened, click "Run Anyways". You may need to click "more info" to see this option.
This warning is entirely harmless and only shows because the app is not signed. Signing it would cost me [€359/year.](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html)
and Do not run the installer as an Administrator!

If this happens to you what you can do is click Green Button or change server.

1. Walk along to the right of all the stations go to the one that has boxes under it or Left Side.

2. Zoom out as much as you can and pull down your camera.

3. Try Line up the red dots with the bowl and the Green Button.

4. Don't forget to !SIT DOWN! [Emotes > Other > Sit] when using it so you don't pass out of a heart attack.
5. Change to Robloxian 2.0 And change to Teen, because it will keep you from slipping on the floor and you can change it in the game.

I recommend that you do this on a private server.

# If you have a problem does not detect the pizza.
What you can try then is to replace the images in the pizza folder.

# Virustotal.
It will likely be mistakenly flagged as a trojan.
I’m not sure how to fix this, I guess I have to get better at coding lol.
Since it moves your mouse and takes a screenshot to identify the Pizza, the system might see it as a threat?.

or just probably because i haven't signed it. [cost me €359/year.](https://shop.certum.eu/data-security/code-signing-certificates/certum-ev-code-sigining.html)
