1. Walk along to the right of all the stations go to the one that has boxes under it

2. Zoom out as much as you can and pull down your camera

3. Try Line up the red dots with the bowl and it's Green Button

I recommend that you do this on a private server

# if you have a problem does not detect the pizza
what you can try then is to replace the images in the pizza folder

# Virustotal
it will be false flagged as a trojan

because it can move your mouse and it takes a screenshot which it uses to find out what the Pizza is

and because it is not signed

# Note: use this at your own risk because you have a small risk of being banned
and it is normal if it looks like the Window has crashed

I was lazy that I didn't make the window refresh when the bot is on
